	Simplification wrapper based on AsOpcUac. It provides simple OPC UA client function blocks with basic functionlities that make it possible to exchange process data from an OPC UA client on B&R PLC systems with OPC UA servers on B&R PLC systems as well as OPC UA servers on other platforms (Windows, Linux, etc.).

      With OPC UA, values are only represented in hexadecimal format. The term "StatusCodes" is also used instead of "error numbers" since a StatusCode describes various states that do not necessary only have to do with errors. For details, see OPC UA StatusCode in AsOpcUac library Automation Studio Help.
