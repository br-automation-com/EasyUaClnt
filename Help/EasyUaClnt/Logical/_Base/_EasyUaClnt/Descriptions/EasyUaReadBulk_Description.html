<p>Compared to UA_ReadList, this block provides considerably better performance for acyclic reading. â€¢A considerably higher number of nodes are possible per call compared to UA_ReadList.</p>
<p class="tips">This function block works <b>asynchronously</b> and must therefore be called until Done == TRUE is returned.</p>
<p class="important">The list of read parameters must have a minimum length of NodeIDCount; otherwise, undefined behavior, access violations and a controller restart can occur. This applies to NodeIDs, NodeAddInfo, variables, NodeErrorIDs and timestamps.</p>
