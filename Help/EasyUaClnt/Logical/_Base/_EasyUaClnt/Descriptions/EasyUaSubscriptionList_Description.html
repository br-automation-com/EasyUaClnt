<p>Sets up a subscription for the information about value changes of defined variables on the OPC UA client. The OPC UA server monitors the variables and sends notification when a value changes. Retrieves monitored variables (monitored items) and modifies parameters.</p>
<p class="tips">This function block works <b>asynchronously</b> and must therefore be called while Active == TRUE.</p>
<p class="important">This function block can only work in firmware sync mode. Controller sync mode is not supported. QueueSize parameter will be ignored.</p>
<p class="important">When the task that defines the variables is transferred, the addresses specified when the block is called lose their scope. To ensure this block functions without errors after transfer, <b>it is recommended to remove the monitored items in the exit subroutine by disabling this function block</b>. The monitored items can then be set up again with this block and the changed variable addresses.</p>
<p class="important">To disable this function block it must be called until Active == FALSE.</p>
